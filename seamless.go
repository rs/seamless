// Package seamless implements a seamless restart strategy for daemons monitored
// by a service supervisor expecting non-forking daemons like daemontools,
// runit, systemd etc.
//
// The seamless strategy is to fully rely on the service supervisor to restart
// the daemon, while providing to the daemon the full control of the restart
// process. To achieve this, seamless duplicates the daemon at startup in order
// to establish a supervisor -> launcher -> daemon relationship. The launcher is
// the first generation of the daemon hijacked by seamless to act as a circuit
// breaker between the supervisor and the supervised process.
//
// This way, when the supervisor sends a TERM signal to stop the daemon, the
// launcher intercepts the signal and send an USR2 signal to its child (the
// actual daemon). In the daemon, seamless intercepts the USR2 signals to
// initiate the first stage of the seamless restart.
//
// During the first stage, the daemon prepare itself to welcome a new version of
// itself by creating a PID file (see below) and by for instance closing file
// descriptors. At this point, the daemon is still supposed to accept requests.
// Once read, seamless make it send a CHLD signal back to the launcher (its
// parent). Upon reception, the launcher, immediately die, cutting to link
// between the supervisor and the daemon, making the supervisor attempting a
// restart of the daemon while current daemon is still running, detached and
// unsupervised.
//
// Once the supervisor restarted the daemon, the daemon can start serving
// traffic in place of the old (still running) daemon by rebinding sockets using
// SO_REUSEPORT for instance (see different strategies in examples/). This is
// the second stage of the seamless restart. When ready, the new daemon calls
// seamless.Started which will look for a PID file, and if found, will send a
// TERM signal to the old daemon using the PID found in this file.
//
// When the old daemon receives this TERM signal, the third and last stage of
// the seamless restart is engaged. The OnShutdown function is called so the
// daemon can gracefully shutdown using Go 1.8 http graceful Shutdown method for
// instance. This stage can last as long as you decide. When done, the old
// process can exit in order to conclude the seamless restart.
//
// Seamless does not try to implement the actual graceful shutdown or to manage
// sockets migration. This task is left to the caller. See the examples
// directory for different implementations.
